Special Collection AR Tour
https://sugary-axolotl.glitch.me/
The HSU Special Collections is incorporating AR into the space to help provide access to a few areas of focus (indigenous history, logging industry, wildlife conservation, etc). Several AR projects make up an interactive display, including images, 3D models and information on Humboldt County history.

> Created using [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) and [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md), hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), with models downloaded from [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com/) (see exhibit for artist information).


## Virtual Reality (VR)

### HSU Gaming Club Introduces a Flight Simulator to Campus
Sarah Kanga Livingstone & Dave Marshall

The PC Gaming club started this project in fall 2018, fundraising and obtaining donations from community members. In spring 2019 the Airplane Flight Simulator became a reality and is open to all students and community members in the HSU Library. Library guests can practice and learn the basics of flying an airplane. Please let us show you how to start the engine, set the flaps and take flight.

Beginning in summer, 2018, Dr. Kwon and the Human Performance Lab created a [virtual reality lab](Virtual Exercise Physiology Lab) using 360-degree video. The virtual lab allows viewers to experience what it is like to be in the Human Performance Lab to conduct wingate tests and more. Stop by the VR Station to experience the lab for yourself!
